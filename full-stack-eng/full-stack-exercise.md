# MySMS Messenger

In this exercise you are requested to develop MySMS Messenger.<br />
MySMS Messenger is a full stack web app allowing the end users to send SMS messages as well as displaying them.<br />
There's no constraint on the framework or language - choose the one that you are most experienced with.<br />


## Section 1/3: Live FE Coding Session
**Time Estimated: <1h**

This part of the exercise focuses on bootstrapping a FE project from scratch.


Goals:

- Examining the candidate's practical know-how with a modern FE framework.

- Examining the candidate's ability to understand a task, scope and plan its execution.

- Building the first building block of the full stack MySMS Messenger app.

## Section 2/3: Backend (Home Exercise)
**Time Estimated: <2h**

In this part of the exercise, you are requested to develop the backend of MySMS Messenger.

Goals:

- Examining the candidate's practical know-how with a modern BE framework.

- Examining the candidate's ability to design a full stack app based on a wireframe mockup.

- Provide the common ground of a follow up system design session.


Please consider the following when designing and implementing the the backend of MySMS Messenger:

- Design of the endpoints, and their HTTP types and naming convention

- Persistency of the data, including the selection of the DB and its schema

- Maintainability and readability of your code

- Awareness of the bottlenecks in terms of scalability and how would you solve them

## Section 3/3: Deploy MySMS Messenger (Home Exercise cont.)
**Time Estimated: <1h**

In this part of the exercise, you are requested to deploy MySMS Messenger.<br />
End result would be a live demo of app that is fully functional.


Once done, please push your code to a public GitHub repo along with a link to the live demo of the app.<br />

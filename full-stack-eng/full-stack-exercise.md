# MySMS Messenger

In this exercise you are requested to develop **MySMS Messenger**.

**MySMS Messenger** is a full stack web app allowing the end users to send SMS messages as well as displaying them.  
The frontend of the app should be written in **Angular**'s latest stable version.  
The backend (API) of the app should be written in **Ruby on Rails** with a database of your choice.


## MySMS Messenger Wireframe

Sending an SMS should be done through [Twilio](https://twilio.com/ "Twilio") API with a free account you've opened on your own.  


## Functionality that we'd like the app to have:

1. Basic authentication - if you're not already logged in the app should ask you to login/create an account by providing a user name and password.
2. Once you're authenticated, you should see the messages you've sent previously and have the ability to send new messages.
3. You should be able to log out

## Bonus 1 - webhooks
Add a reflection to the message cards showing that twilio successfully delivered the message:

## Bonus 2 - Deploy The App

In this part of the exercise, you are requested to deploy MySMS Messenger.  
End result would be a live demo of app that is fully functional.


Once done, please push your code to a public GitHub repo along with a link to the live demo of the app.
